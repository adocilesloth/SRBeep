Plugin to play a sound when starting/stopping
streaming/recording/buffer or pausing/unpausing
recording.

**===WINDOWS===**
Windows is built and working for 64bit
Has all required .dlls

Drag and drop obs-studio folder into C:\Program Files
(or wher ever you have obs-studio installed)
Merge all files down and you should be good to go.

**===LINUX===**
Dependancies:
OBS (duh)
FFmpeg (you should have this if you have a working obs)
SDL2 (Simple Directmedia Layer, see https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.24.1)

Clone the git repo:  
	`git clone https://github.com/adocilesloth/SRBeep.git`  
	
cd to where you downloaded the source  

Check the environment PATHS in Makefile  
	Make sure they match your OBS and FFmpeg and SDL2 installations and fix if necessary.  
	(`OBS_API_INCLUDE` will not need updating as the files are in the git repo)  
  
Then run:  
```
make  
make install  
make clean (optional: if you want to remove the temporary .o and .so files)
```

Ubuntu 22.04 is built and working for 64bit:
Drag and drop obs-studio folder into ~/.config  
Merge all files down and you should be good to go.

You'll probably have to move the .so.## for ffmpeg into
/usr/lib/ from the release ./depends folder
but obs-studio should throw a warning for each .so.## (one at a
time) when it tries to load the module to tell you what they are.
They should be in the ffmpeg/lib folder (where ever that may be
for you)

**===MAC===**
Uh, sould work. Probably. Don't have a MAC to test with.  
So...  
You can try the LINUX instructions.  
Let me know if you get it to work!
